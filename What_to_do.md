## Steps to Modify the System

To align ENG with your requirements (speed, accuracy, complex algorithms, self-learning, and seamless workflow), follow these steps to modify the existing codebase. These steps focus on enhancing self-learning, dynamic learning, the parser, and workflow integration without writing code, as requested.

#### 2.1 Enhance Self-Learning Capabilities
1. **Implement a Robust Feedback Loop**:
   - Modify `ui.py` to prompt users for feedback after each command (e.g., “Is this output correct? [Y/N]”).
   - Update `feedback.py` to store feedback (input, intent, parameters, AST, output, user response) in FAISS with embeddings.
   - Add a mechanism to flag incorrect outputs for manual review or model retraining.
   - **Why**: Feedback drives model improvement and ensures user trust.

2. **Enable Online Learning**:
   - Update `nlu/trainer.py` to support online learning with small batch updates (e.g., using `torch.optim` for gradient updates).
   - Use feedback from `feedback.py` to fine-tune the NLU model periodically (e.g., every 100 interactions).
   - Implement reinforcement learning (e.g., using `Stable-Baselines3`) to optimize intent prediction based on user corrections.
   - **Why**: Online learning ensures ENG adapts to new inputs without retraining from scratch.

3. **Expand Memory System**:
   - Enhance `memory.py` to store full context (input, tokenized input, intent, parameters, AST, output, feedback) in FAISS.
   - Add a similarity search to retrieve past similar inputs for better predictions.
   - Store variable states for multi-step commands to maintain context.
   - **Why**: A rich memory system enables learning from past interactions and improves multi-step handling.

4. **Schedule Periodic Retraining**:
   - Create a script (`scripts/retrain.py`) to periodically retrain the NLU model using new data from `memory.py`.
   - Use a larger dataset by combining synthetic, manual, and user-generated data.
   - **Why**: Periodic retraining ensures the model stays current with user patterns.

#### 2.2 Enable Dynamic Learning
1. **Dynamic Intent Addition**:
   - Modify `generate_data.py` to allow adding new intents dynamically based on unrecognized inputs.
   - Create a script (`scripts/add_intent.py`) to analyze frequent unrecognized inputs and propose new templates.
   - Update `nlu/model.py` to retrain with new intents without disrupting existing ones.
   - **Why**: Dynamic intents allow ENG to adapt to novel commands.

2. **Context-Aware NLU**:
   - Enhance `nlu/model.py` to maintain a context dictionary for multi-step commands, tracking variables (e.g., `N`, `l1`, `l2`) and their states.
   - Update `nlu/tokenizer.py` to include context tokens (e.g., previous step’s output) in the input sequence.
   - **Why**: Context awareness ensures accurate parameter extraction for complex algorithms.

3. **Paraphrase Expansion**:
   - Improve `data_augmentation.py` to generate more diverse paraphrases using a larger language model (e.g., GPT-2 via `transformers`).
   - Add structural variations for complex commands (e.g., “sum evens” → “aggregate even integers”).
   - **Why**: A diverse dataset improves robustness to varied phrasings.

4. **Confidence-Based Learning**:
   - Update `nlu/model.py` to output confidence scores for intent and parameter predictions.
   - If confidence is below a threshold (e.g., 0.9), prompt the user for clarification in `ui.py` (e.g., “Did you mean ‘sum’ or ‘add’?”).
   - Store clarification responses in `memory.py` to improve future predictions.
   - **Why**: Confidence-based learning reduces errors and improves accuracy.

#### 2.3 Build a Robust Pre-Contained Parser
1. **Enhance Tokenization**:
   - Update `nlu/tokenizer.py` to use a hybrid approach: spaCy for POS tagging and dependency parsing, plus a custom tokenizer for programming-specific terms (e.g., “linked list”).
   - Add support for multi-step tokenization, splitting inputs into steps based on keywords (e.g., “Step”, “then”).
   - **Why**: A robust tokenizer handles both simple and complex inputs accurately.

2. **Improve Intent and Parameter Extraction**:
   - Upgrade the NLU model in `nlu/model.py` to a larger transformer (e.g., T5-base or RoBERTa) for better accuracy.
   - Train on a more diverse dataset with complex examples (e.g., multi-step algorithms, nested loops).
   - Add named entity recognition (NER) for parameters like ranges, variables, and filters.
   - **Why**: A powerful NLU model ensures 100% accuracy in intent and parameter extraction.

3. **Robust AST Generation**:
   - Enhance `ir.rs` to support complex control structures (e.g., nested `If`, `ForLoop`, `WhileLoop`) in the IR.
   - Add support for variable scoping and state tracking in the IR for multi-step commands.
   - Create a mapping from NLU outputs to IR nodes for all intents (e.g., `AddLinkedLists` → sequence of IR nodes).
   - **Why**: A robust AST supports complex algorithms and ensures correct execution.

4. **Ambiguity Resolution**:
   - Add a module in `nlu/model.py` to detect ambiguous inputs (e.g., low confidence or multiple possible intents).
   - Modify `ui.py` to ask for clarification (e.g., “Do you mean ‘sum’ or ‘add’?”) and store responses in `memory.py`.
   - **Why**: Resolving ambiguity ensures 100% accuracy and improves user experience.

#### 2.4 Align Workflow
1. **Streamline UI Interaction**:
   - Update `ui.py` to handle multi-step inputs by parsing steps separately and maintaining a session context.
   - Add natural language feedback for errors (e.g., “I didn’t understand ‘sum evens’, please rephrase”).
   - Include a history feature to recall and modify previous commands.
   - **Why**: A user-friendly UI simplifies interaction and supports complex tasks.

2. **Integrate Tokenization and NLU**:
   - Ensure `ui.py` calls `nlu/tokenizer.py` to tokenize inputs before passing to `nlu/model.py`.
   - Update `nlu/model.py` to return a structured output (intent, parameters, confidence) for each input.
   - **Why**: Seamless integration ensures accurate processing of user inputs.

3. **Optimize AST Generation**:
   - Modify `ir.rs` to generate a complete AST for multi-step commands, combining individual step IRs into a single program.
   - Add validation to ensure the AST is executable (e.g., check for undefined variables).
   - **Why**: A complete AST ensures correct execution of complex algorithms.

4. **Enhance Rust Execution**:
   - Update `executor.rs` to fully implement complex algorithms (e.g., `AddLinkedLists` with proper carry propagation and pointer swapping).
   - Integrate LLVM (`inkwell` crate) for JIT compilation to match Java/C/C++ speed.
   - Add parallel execution for compute-intensive tasks (e.g., using `Tokio` for summing large ranges).
   - **Why**: Fast, correct execution is critical for performance and reliability.

5. **Return and Display Output**:
   - Modify `ui.py` to format Rust execution outputs in a user-friendly way (e.g., “The sum is 30” instead of just “30”).
   - Add support for displaying multi-step outputs (e.g., intermediate results for debugging).
   - **Why**: Clear output enhances user experience and supports complex tasks.

#### 2.5 Optimize Speed and Accuracy
1. **Upgrade NLU Model**:
   - Replace T5-small with T5-base or RoBERTa in `model_config.yaml` for better accuracy.
   - Fine-tune on a larger, more diverse dataset (e.g., 1M+ examples) including complex algorithms.
   - **Why**: A larger model improves intent and parameter extraction accuracy.

2. **Optimize Rust Execution**:
   - Integrate LLVM in `executor.rs` for JIT compilation of IR nodes.
   - Use `Tokio` for parallel execution of independent tasks (e.g., summing ranges).
   - Cache common results in `executor.rs` to avoid recomputation.
   - **Why**: These optimizations ensure Java/C/C++-like speed.

3. **Support Complex Algorithms**:
   - Fully implement `AddLinkedLists`, `GraphDFS`, `GraphBFS`, etc., in `executor.rs` with proper logic for carry, pointers, and graph traversal.
   - Add support for nested control structures (e.g., loops within conditionals) in `ir.rs` and `executor.rs`.
   - **Why**: Complete implementations ensure ENG handles complex tasks accurately.

4. **Minimize Python Overhead**:
   - Move critical NLU logic (e.g., tokenization, parameter extraction) to Rust if Python becomes a bottleneck.
   - Use `PyO3` to streamline Python-Rust integration.
   - **Why**: Reducing Python overhead improves overall speed.

#### 2.6 Minimize Error Handling
1. **Natural Language Feedback**:
   - Update `ui.py` to provide natural language error messages (e.g., “I couldn’t process ‘sum evens’, please clarify the range”).
   - Log errors in `eng.log` with detailed context for debugging.
   - **Why**: User-friendly feedback aligns with the English-based interface.

2. **Confidence-Based Clarification**:
   - Add a confidence threshold in `nlu/model.py` to detect uncertain predictions.
   - Prompt users for clarification in `ui.py` when confidence is low.
   - **Why**: Clarification reduces errors without complex syntax checking.

3. **Robust Testing**:
   - Expand `test_nlu.py`, `test_executor.py`, and `test_integration.py` to cover complex algorithms and edge cases.
   - Add tests for multi-step commands and ambiguous inputs.
   - **Why**: Thorough testing ensures reliability without heavy error handling.

### 3. Example Workflow Implementation
To illustrate how the modified system will handle your examples:

#### Example 1: Simple Task (Sum Even Numbers)
- **User Input** (in `ui.py`): “Read N and sum all even numbers from 1 to N, then print the result.”
- **Tokenization** (`nlu/tokenizer.py`):
  - Split into tokens: ["read", "N", "sum", "all", "even", "numbers", "from", "1", "to", "N", "print", "result"].
  - Add POS tags and context (e.g., `N:VAR`, `1:NUM`).
- **NLU** (`nlu/model.py`):
  - Intents: ["Read", "SumEvens", "Print"].
  - Parameters: {"N": "variable", "range": [1, "N"], "filter": "even"}.
  - Confidence: 0.95 (if low, prompt for clarification).
- **AST Generation** (`ir.rs`):
  - Generate: `print(sum(filter(even_number, range(1, N))))`.
  - Store context: `N` as a variable.
- **Execution** (`executor.rs`):
  - Prompt user for `N` (e.g., 10).
  - Compute: `filter(even_number, [1, 2, ..., 10]) → [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.
  - Sum: `2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30`.
- **Output** (`ui.py`): “The sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is 30.”
- **Learning** (`memory.py`, `feedback.py`):
  - Store: input, tokens, intents, parameters, AST, output.
  - Prompt: “Is this correct? [Y/N]” → If “Y”, reinforce model; if “N”, flag for retraining.

#### Example 2: Complex Task (Add Two Linked Lists)
- **User Input** (in `ui.py`):
  ```
  Step 1: Check if first list is null or zero, return second list.
  Step 2: Check if second list is null or zero, return first list.
  Step 3: Initialize pointers first, second, and prev.
  Step 4: Find lengths of both lists.
  Step 5: If second list is longer, swap first and second.
  Step 6: Traverse first list, add second list’s values and carry, update carry.
  Step 7: If carry remains, add new node.
  Step 8: Return longer list.
  ```
- **Tokenization** (`nlu/tokenizer.py`):
  - Split into steps and tokenize each (e.g., Step 1: ["check", "if", "first", "list", "is", "null", ...]).
  - Add POS tags and context (e.g., `first:LIST`, `null:COND`).
- **NLU** (`nlu/model.py`):
  - Parse each step:
    - Step 1: Intent: `Conditional`, Parameters: `[l1, null, 0, l2]`.
    - Step 3: Intent: `Initialize`, Parameters: `[first, second, prev]`.
    - Step 6: Intent: `Loop`, Parameters: `[first, second, carry]`.
  - Maintain context: `l1`, `l2`, `first`, `second`, `prev`, `carry`.
- **AST Generation** (`ir.rs`):
  - Generate:
    ```
    if (l1 == null || l1.val == 0) return l2;
    if (l2 == null || l2.val == 0) return l1;
    first = l1; second = l2; prev = null;
    len1 = length(l1); len2 = length(l2);
    if (len2 > len1) swap(first, second);
    while (first != null) { ... }
    if (carry != 0) prev.next = new Node(carry);
    return len1 > len2 ? l1 : l2;
    ```
- **Execution** (`executor.rs`):
  - Input: `l1 = [2,4,3]`, `l2 = [5,6,4]`.
  - Execute: Add lists with carry propagation → `[7,0,8]` (342 + 465 = 807).
- **Output** (`ui.py`): “The sum of the linked lists is [7,0,8].”
- **Learning** (`memory.py`, `feedback.py`):
  - Store: multi-step input, tokens, intents, parameters, AST, output.
  - Prompt: “Is this correct? [Y/N]” → Use feedback to fine-tune NLU.
