# EvalX Optimization Plan: Phase 3 - Advanced Scaling & Features

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on **outperforming Judge0** by adding advanced features, automated scaling, and production-ready observability. The goal is to handle **10,000+ requests seamlessly** and provide features Judge0 lacks.

**Key Goals for Phase 3:**
- Implement automatic scaling based on workload.
- Add advanced features like webhooks and AI-powered hints.
- Introduce comprehensive monitoring and alerting.
- Prepare for production deployment on cloud infrastructure.

## Phase 3 Changes Summary

### 1. Dynamic, Automated Scaling
**Current State:** Static number of worker processes defined in Docker Compose.

**Changes Needed:**
- **Local Simulation with Minikube:**
  - Install Minikube to create a local Kubernetes cluster.
  - Create `minikube-config.yaml` defining a Kubernetes Deployment for the evalX worker.
  - Implement a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) that scales the number of worker pods based on CPU usage or, more ideally, a custom metric (like the Redis queue length).
- **Custom Metrics Adapter:** Use Prometheus to scrape the queue length from Redis. Configure Kubernetes to use this metric for scaling decisions.
- **Production Ready:** This same configuration can be directly applied to AWS EKS or Google GKE.

**Benefits:**
- **Cost Efficiency:** Automatically scales up during traffic spikes and down during quiet periods.
- **Handles Any Load:** The system can automatically adapt to handle 10k or 100k requests without manual intervention.

**Files to Modify/Create:**
- **New:** `minikube-config.yaml` (Kubernetes Deployment, Service, and HPA definitions)
- `src/monitoring/metrics.rs` (Expose custom metrics for queue depth)
- **New:** `prometheus.yml` (Configuration to scrape custom metrics)

### 2. Enhanced Monitoring & Alerting
**Current State:** Basic Prometheus metrics exposed on an endpoint.

**Changes Needed:**
- **Grafana Dashboards:** Create comprehensive dashboards visualizing:
  - Request throughput and latency (p95, p99)
  - Queue depth and worker count
  - Cache hit rate and efficiency
  - Sandbox (Isolate/Docker) utilization and error rates
- **Alerting:** Configure Prometheus Alertmanager to send alerts (e.g., to Slack or email) for:
  - Queue depth growing too large
  - Error rate exceeding a threshold
  - Cache hit rate dropping significantly

**Benefits:**
- **Proactive Operation:** Identify and fix bottlenecks before they impact users.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Precisely measure the impact of optimizations.

**Files to Modify/Create:**
- **New:** `grafana/dashboards/evalx.json` (Exported Grafana dashboard)
- **New:** `prometheus/alert.rules.yml` (Alerting rules)

### 3. Value-Added Features (To Beat Judge0)
**Current State:** A fast, but basic, code execution API.

**Changes Needed:**
- **Webhook Support:**
  - In `src/models/request.rs`, add an optional `webhook_url` field.
  - In the worker, after processing a job, if a webhook URL is provided, send a POST request with the result to that URL.
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff for failed webhook deliveries.
- **AI-Powered Hints:**
  - In `src/models/response.rs`, add an optional `hints: Vec<String>` field to the response.
  - In `src/executor.rs`, upon execution failure, analyze the `stderr` output.
  - Use simple pattern matching (e.g., for common compilation errors) or integrate with a local LLM to generate helpful hints for the user.
- **Optional Submission History:**
  - Add `sqlx` and a SQLite/PostgreSQL driver to `Cargo.toml`.
  - Create a `src/db/` module to store tokens, code, and results in a database for long-term history and analysis.

**Benefits:**
- **Superior Developer Experience:** Webhooks are more efficient than polling. Hints provide immense educational value.
- **Competitive Advantage:** Offers features that Judge0 does not provide out-of-the-box.

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/models/request.rs` (Add `webhook_url`)
- `src/models/response.rs` (Add `hints`)
- `src/executor.rs` (Add logic to generate hints from errors)
- `src/controllers/notificationControllers.rs` (New module to handle webhook calls)
- `Cargo.toml` (Add `sqlx`, `reqwest` for webhooks)

### 4. Production Preparation
**Current State:** Optimized for local development.

**Changes Needed:**
- **Environment-Based Configuration:** Ensure all configuration (Redis URL, feature flags) is loaded from environment variables for Twelve-Factor App compliance.
- **Health Checks:** Add a `/health` endpoint that checks connections to Redis and the overall system status.
- **Security Hardening:** Ensure Isolate sandboxes are properly locked down. Use environment variables for secrets, not the `.env` file in production.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create GitHub Actions workflows to automatically build, test, and deploy the application to a cloud provider.

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/routes.rs` (Add `/health` endpoint)
- `Dockerfile` (Multi-stage build for production)
- **New:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (CI/CD pipeline)

## Summary: The Asynchronous Token-Based Flow Across All Phases

This architecture is the golden thread connecting all phases:

1.  **Phase 1 (Foundation):** The Redis-based queue and cache store the tokens and results.
2.  **Phase 2 (Core):** Broccoli manages the job queue reliably. Isolate processes the jobs at incredible speed. The async API model is implemented.
3.  **Phase 3 (Advanced):** The system scales automatically based on the queue depth. Webhooks provide async results. Monitoring tracks the entire async workflow.

By the end of Phase 3, evalX will not just be faster than Judge0; it will be a more robust, scalable, and feature-rich platform, ready for production traffic at any scale.
