#### Week 1 : Dataset Preparation 
**Goal**: Prepare the Dataset, follow `DatasetPrep.md`

#### Week 2: Upgrade the NLU Model
**Goal**: Replace the current `TransformerModel` with a powerful transformer and train it on the dataset.
- **Day 1–2**: Set up a pretrained transformer (e.g., DistilBERT or T5) using Hugging Face.
  - Install: `pip install transformers`.
  - Load a model: `from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer`.
- **Day 3–4**: Fine-tune on the dataset for intent classification and parameter extraction.
  - Use a script like `trainer.py` to train on the Parquet dataset.
  - Add a CRF layer or pointer network for parameter extraction.
- **Day 5–6**: Implement online learning to update weights based on user feedback.
  - Use PyTorch’s `torch.optim` for gradient updates.
- **Day 7**: Test on 100 examples to ensure accuracy.
**Time Estimate**: 56 hours (8 hours/day).
**Example**: Fine-tuning DistilBERT to classify intents and extract parameters like `{"range": [1, 10]}`.

#### Week 3: Enhance the Executor
**Goal**: Rewrite `executor.rs` to handle ASTs and complex constructs with C++-like speed.
- **Day 1–2**: Define AST structures for loops, conditionals, and built-in methods.
  - Use Rust’s `enum` and `struct` for AST nodes.
- **Day 3–4**: Integrate LLVM to compile ASTs to machine code.
  - Install: `cargo add llvm-sys`.
- **Day 5–6**: Implement built-in methods (e.g., `even_number`, `sum`, `linked_list`).
- **Day 7**: Test on simple and complex tasks (e.g., sum evens, add linked lists).
**Time Estimate**: 56 hours.
**Example**: Compile `sum(filter(even, range(1, N)))` to machine code for fast execution.

#### Week 4: Implement Memory and Learning
**Goal**: Build a robust memory system and online learning pipeline.
- **Day 1–2**: Set up FAISS for storing input embeddings.
  - Install: `pip install faiss-cpu`.
- **Day 3–4**: Implement similarity search to reuse past inputs.
- **Day 5–6**: Add reinforcement learning for fine-tuning based on feedback.
- **Day 7**: Test memory system with user inputs.
**Time Estimate**: 56 hours.
**Example**: Store “sum evens from 1 to 10” and retrieve it for “total even numbers”.

#### Week 5: Test and Optimize
**Goal**: Ensure accuracy and speed.
- **Day 1–3**: Test on 500 examples (simple and complex).
- **Day 4–5**: Optimize model with quantization (use `torch.quantization`).
- **Day 6–7**: Optimize executor with caching and multithreading (use Rust’s `tokio`).
**Time Estimate**: 56 hours.
**Example**: Run “add two linked lists” and verify output matches Java’s.

### Addressing Your Concerns
- **No Dataset Online**: You’re right that no exact dataset exists for ENG. That’s why synthetic data (80%) and adapted scraped data (20%) are key. The week-long plan focuses on generating data quickly and transforming scraped text into ENG’s format.
- **Speed and Efficiency**: Using Rust and LLVM ensures C++-like speed. Model quantization and caching make the NLU fast.
- **Multi-Step Algorithms**: The new data structure (with ASTs) and context manager handle step-by-step instructions by maintaining state across steps.
- **Tech Stack**: Keep Python and Rust, but add Transformers, FAISS, and LLVM. These are standard for AI and high-performance systems.

### Final Thoughts
In one week, you can build a dataset with 100,000 examples by generating synthetic data and adapting scraped text. Over the next four weeks, you can upgrade the model, executor, memory, and testing to create a fast, accurate ENG. It’s like building a smart robot: the dataset is its brain’s training, the model is its understanding, the executor is its muscles, and the memory is its learning ability. You’re not far from making ENG a reality—just focus on these streamlined steps.

If you want code for any part (e.g., `generate_data.py`) or a deeper dive into another task, let me know!
